This repository wants to explore different solutions for the
[Severstal](https://www.kaggle.com/c/severstal-steel-defect-detection/overview)
competition hosted by Kaggle. Kaggle is a platform that provides various
datasets from the real world machine learning problems and engages a
large community of people. Severstal is a Russian company operating in
the steel and mining industry. It creates a vast industrial data lake
and in the 2019 looked to machine learning to improve automation,
increase efficiency, and maintain high quality in their production.

The goal is to detect steel defects with segmentation models. The
solutions are based on
[Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) with
[FastAI](https://docs.fast.ai/#Installing) as high level deep learning
framework.

In this repository you will find some Jupyter Notebooks used to build
the `steel_segmentation` library with [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/)
and the training notebooks.

In the
[steel_deployment](https://github.com/marcomatteo/steel_deployment)
repository you can find a Binder/Voila web app for the deployment of the
models built with this library (still updating).

## Install

To install this package, clone and install the repository and install
via:

    pip install git+https://github.com/marcomatteo/steel_segmentation.git

### Editable install

To install and edit this package:

    clone git+https://github.com/marcomatteo/steel_segmentation.git
    pip install -e steel_segmentation

The library is based on `nbdev`, a powerful tool that builds a python
package from Juptyer Notebooks.

    pip install nbdev

To create the library, the documentation and tests use these commands:

    nbdev_clean_nbs
    nbdev_build_lib
    nbdev_test_nbs
    nbdev_build_docs

This enviroment works on MacOS and Linux. In Windows the WLS with Ubuntu
20.04 is raccomended.

Training only in Windows needs one package more to solve `ipykernel`
issues:

    conda install pywin32

## Download the dataset

To download the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) competition data you
will need an account (if this is the first time with the API follow this
[link](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api)) to generate the
credentials, download and copy the `kaggle.json` into the repository
directory.

``` python
!mkdir ~/.kaggle
!cp ../kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
!chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
```

Now you’re authenticated with the Kaggle API (you’ll need `kaggle` so
`pip install kaggle` first), download and unzip the data:

``` python
!kaggle competitions download -c severstal-steel-defect-detection -p {path}
!mkdir data
!unzip -q -n {path}/severstal-steel-defect-detection.zip -d {path}
```

## Library notebooks

All of the experiments are based on Jupyter Notebooks and in the `nbs`
folder there are all the notebooks used to build the
`steel_segmentation` library (still updating):

- [Explorating Data
  Analysis](https://marcomatteo.github.io/steel_segmentation/eda.html):
  data analysis, plots and utility functions.
- [Transforms](https://marcomatteo.github.io/steel_segmentation/transforms.html):
  leveraging Middle-level API of `fastai` for custom data loading
  pipeline.
- [Optimizer utility
  functions](https://marcomatteo.github.io/steel_segmentation/optimizer.html)
- [Loss
  functions](https://marcomatteo.github.io/steel_segmentation/loss.html)
- [Metrics](https://marcomatteo.github.io/steel_segmentation/metrics.html)

## Training

Training script in `scripts` folder:

- `segmentation_train.py`: training segmentation models from [qubvel
  repository](https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch).
- `create_submission.py` : create a kaggle submission from a
  segmentation model trained and save the csv in `data/submissions/`.
